What Color Should I Paint My Kitchen with White From jimenezphoto.com</p>
<p>We chose polar white kitchen cupboards, and found the perfect match in dulux white on white for walls (low sheen) and ceiling (in ceiling paint) and trims (acrylic gloss). Mixing and matching whites is ricky business as one white can easily make another look dirty/warm/cool/etc…. This kitchen goes for a bold look with a black oven and range hood cover and wood cabinets lining the lower half. White is an easy and safe choice of paint color to go with cherry cabinets.</p>
<h3 id="while-i-wouldnt-partner-warm-and-cool-whites-together-nor-would-i-pair-a-true-white-and-warm-white-unless-the-true-white-were-on-cabinetstrim-there-are-a-few-warm-white-combinations-that-are-doable-as-long-as-your-trimcabinets-should-be-a-lighter-white-than-your-walls">While i wouldn’t partner warm and cool whites together, nor would i pair a true white and warm white unless the true white were on cabinets/trim, there are a few warm white combinations that are doable as long as your trim/cabinets should be a lighter white than your walls.</h3><p>Darker cabinets offer drama and contrast, and can even serve as a focal point. The walls get painted the same color as the lower cabinets in the kitchen for continuity, or maybe a shade that is similar but not exactly matching. Mixing and matching whites is ricky business as one white can easily make another look dirty/warm/cool/etc…. I need to finish painting the wooden doors to the kitchen and bathroom white too, and put a coat of colorful paint on the wooden step stool. White cabinets with a glossy finish will further help bounce light around, and can give the illusion of a larger space. This kitchen goes for a bold look with a black oven and range hood cover and wood cabinets lining the lower half.</p>
